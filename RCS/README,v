Purpose:

  DB.pm implements the perl package HP200LX::DB which is intended
  to provide a perl 5 interface for files in the generic database
  format of the HP 200 LX palmtop computer.  The perl modules are
  intended to be used on a work station such as a PC or a Unix
  machine to read and write data records from and to a database
  file.

Goals and Non-Goals of this Project:

  The primary goal was to read and write complete generic database
  files, e.g. GDB, PDB or NDB files on a host computer.  The
  transfer from and to the palmtop computer, synchronization and
  reconciliation are not considered at all.  Also, other built-in
  applications operate on slightly different DB files, these
  are not dealt with yet.  The creation, definition and layout
  are not handled yet.

  Project Roadmap:
  1. read/write GDB, PDB, and NDB files [quite complete]
  2. a simple GUI to browse the DB files [in progress]
  3. tools to import/export data in different formats [in progress]
  4. extend the DB module for ADB and WDB files
  5. creation of DB files including format definitions etc.
  6. dealing with encrypted DB files

Status:

  The package and any other files are in a completely EXPERIMENTAL
  STATUS and should not be used without proper backup.  Use it at your
  own risk, no support can be provided but bug reports and suggestions
  by e-mail are welcome.  Please read the notes below first.

  **WARNING**  This is already working but it's not completed yet!

Availability and Contact:

  This package is available from my FTP archive
  ftp://ftp.wu-wien.ac.at/pub/usr/edvz/gonter/hp200lx/
  and I can be reached as Gerhard.Gonter@@wu-wien.ac.at
  or g.gonter@@ieee.org .
  Redistribution is permitted but it must include the README file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

interface functions
  $db= HP200LX::DB::openDB ($fnm)     read database and return an DB object
  $db= HP200LX::DB::new ($fnm)        create database and return an DB object
  $db->saveDB ($fnm)                  save DB object as a (new) file

array tie implementation to access database data records
  tie (@@dbd, HP200LX::DB, $db);       access database data in array form
  TIEARRAY                            stub to get an tie for the database
  FETCH                               retrieve a record         ** UNFINISHED **
  STORE                               store a record            ** UNFINISHED **
  $db->get_last_index ()              return highest index

Notes:
All database data are read from file or written back in one burst.
No attempt has been made to read data when it is accessed by the
perl application.  This only complicates matters and does not seem
to be necessar since a type HP 200 LX only has about 4 MB to store.


Things left to be done for later:

  $db2= $db1->dupDB ()                  copy the database
  $db->clearDB ()                       delete data and note elements
  $db->delete ($num)                    delete a data record including note


retrieve DB format
$fmt->{$Fieldname}=
{
  'type'        => type code,
  'min_size'    => minimum size to display, e.g. DATE == 10 as in 1998-01-11
  'max_size'    => maximum size to display
};

formatted print list output somehow

-----
possible import/export application which are not too specific:
+ synchronization of a Phone Database with ELM/Pine/Netscape address books
+ Netscape bookmarks
